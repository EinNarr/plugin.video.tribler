Raul's TO DO list:

- Use good variable names (you can add comments also if you like)

- Use PEP8 code style

- Save user data in ~/.pymdht/ (for instance ~/.pymdht/data_files and
torrent_pages). See interactive_dht.py how to use
os.path.expanduser('~'). Even better, you can use the path given in
options.path from the command line options.
 - If the directory does not exist, you should create it instead of
 crashing. See interactive_dht.py how to use os.path.exists(options.path)

- The SAVE icon should not be the same as EXIT, it's confusing.

- In "graphical display" it would help if "browse" were on the left, then the
  "choice box", and finally "load" because that's the user's sequence.
